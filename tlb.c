/*
1. 
   - The gettimeofday() function provides microsecond precision. 
     However, the actual precision can be affected by the systemâ€™s clock resolution and the overhead of the function call itself.
   - To time an operation precisely, it should take at least a few microseconds. 
     For very short operations, you may need to repeat the operation many times in a loop and measure the total time to get an accurate average.

5. I can use the volatile keyword to prevent the compiler from optimizing away the loop.

6. That can be achieved by using  `sched_setaffinity` to pin the process to a specific CPU.

/*
7. Yes, it will affect the timing. 
   Initialize the array before starting the timing loop to ensure that all pages are allocated and zeroed can help to counterbalance this.
